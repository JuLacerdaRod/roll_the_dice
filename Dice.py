# Write a program that simulates rolling dice.

# When the program runs, it will:

# 1. Ask the user how many times they would like to roll the dice

# 2. Randomly choose a number between 1 and 6, for the number of dice that the user has indicated.  
# The number rolled will be printed.

# 3. Ask the user if theyâ€™d like to roll again.  If yes, go to step one.  Otherwise, exit.
